The retail dataset we have has information on online store sales throughout Brazil, with a variety of products. Working with different sales channels.

Business premises:
when analyzing the data when there is no "UF" value, consider "MS" - to correct a systemic error. When the final price of a product is higher than the price + shipping, this data must be disregarded because it is invalid.

We evaluate the following metrics:
1- department with the most sales
2- average price with shipping by department
3- amount of sales per month
4- sales average by sales channel
5- average age of customers by brand
